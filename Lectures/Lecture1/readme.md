## Assignment:
Michael was in such a hurry to get to the lecture, that he messed up both vertex and the fragment shader!
Instead of a beautiful and wel-lit sphere, he got a strange stripy figure.

Since he is your teacher, he asked you to repeat his mistakes, claiming that "it is supposed to look like that". You can find his broken version under releases tab of the github repo.
Use RenderDoc to peek into the messy shaders he made and change Assets/Scripts/BrokenShader.shader in such way, that the sphere in Assets/HomeWork/BrokenSphere.unity looks exactly the same as Michael's.

Hint: you can attach RenderDoc to unity AND to the broken build to see the difference between the shaders.
